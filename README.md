Movie Challange Project

- Used Swift 5 language
- Used MVVM design pattern
- Used Cocoapods for library management
- Used self producted UIView Layout extensions
- Used self producted network layer
- Used Codable for mapping json

Used third party libraries:

1. Kingfisher and SDWebImage;
For downloading images to UIImageViews from url or url strings.

2. NVActivityIndicatorView/Extended;
For showing loader animation while service layer working background.
I also used extended version of this pod because my project supporting until iOS 11.0.
So I have to use eligible implementation method for this usage.

3. PullToRefresher;
For showing loader animation on top of UITableView while refreshing table view data.
